          <h3>Governance and other initiatives</h3>
        
          <div>Modi's first year as prime minister saw significant centralisation of power relative to previous administrations.[134][202] His efforts at centralisation have been linked to an increase in the number of senior administration officials resigning their positions.[134] Initially lacking a majority in the Rajya Sabha, or upper house of Indian Parliament, Modi passed a number of ordinances to enact his policies, leading to further centralisation of power.[203] The government also passed a bill increasing the control that it had over the appointment of judges, and reducing that of the judiciary.[16]

            <li><strong>Early life and education -</strong> Narendra Damodardas Modi was born on 17 September 1950 to a Gujarati Hindu family of grocers in Vadnagar, Mehsana district, Bombay State (present-day Gujarat). He was the third of six children born to Damodardas Mulchand Modi (c. 1915–1989) and Hiraben Modi (born c. 1920).[21][a] Modi's family belonged to the Modh-Ghanchi-Teli (oil-presser) community,[22][23][24] which is categorised as an Other Backward Class by the Indian government.[24][25]</li>
            <li><strong>Early political career -</strong>In June 1975, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi declared a state of emergency in India which lasted until 1977. During this period, known as "The Emergency", many of her political opponents were jailed and opposition groups were banned. </li>
            <li><strong>Taking office -</strong> In 2001, Keshubhai Patel's health was failing and the BJP lost a few state assembly seats in by-elections. Allegations of abuse of power, corruption and poor administration were made, and Patel's standing had been damaged by his administration's handling of the earthquake in Bhuj in 2001.</li>
            <li><strong>2002 Gujarat riots -</strong> On 27 February 2002, a train with several hundred passengers burned near Godhra, killing approximately 60 people.[h][95] The train carried a large number of Hindu pilgrims returning from Ayodhya after a religious ceremony at the site of the demolished Babri Masjid.</li>
            <li><strong>2002 election -</strong> In the aftermath of the violence there were widespread calls for Modi to resign as chief minister from within and outside the state, including from leaders of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam and the Telugu Desam Party (allies in the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance coalition), and opposition parties stalled Parliament over the issue.</li>
